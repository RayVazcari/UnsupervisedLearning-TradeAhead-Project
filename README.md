### **Project Overview**

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and group stocks from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for Trade&Ahead, a financial consultancy firm specializing in personalized investment strategies. The goal was to identify clusters of stocks with similar financial characteristics, providing investors with diversified options for portfolio construction and risk management. Using data attributes such as volatility, return on equity (ROE), cash flow, and valuation metrics, I aimed to uncover meaningful patterns that would simplify the decision-making process for investors seeking to balance growth, stability, and liquidity.

I began by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataâ€™s structure and distribution, focusing on financial indicators that could impact clustering outcomes. This analysis involved examining the variance in attributes like volatility, P/E ratio, and net cash flow, which are pivotal in distinguishing stocks by risk and performance. I leveraged data visualization techniques to explore correlations and distributions, helping to pinpoint the most informative features for clustering.

With a strong understanding of the data, I implemented K-Means Clustering as the primary clustering technique, selecting optimal parameters through Elbow Method analysis to ensure clear, well-separated clusters. To verify the consistency of the clustering structure, I also applied Hierarchical Clustering, which allowed for the identification of potential hierarchical relationships within stock categories, offering a complementary view to the K-Means results.

Once clusters were defined, I conducted a Cluster Profiling process to understand each groupâ€™s unique characteristics, such as average volatility, growth potential, and liquidity measures. Profiling each cluster provided Trade&Ahead with specific insights into the types of stocks each group contained, making it easier to match clients with stocks aligned to their investment objectives.

### **Summary of Findings**

- `Cluster 1 - High ROE, Low Volatility`: This group featured stocks with high Return on Equity and low volatility, making it ideal for risk-averse investors focused on steady income. Companies in this cluster typically have stable financial health and are less impacted by market fluctuations.
- `Cluster 2 - Growth-Oriented Stocks`: Characterized by high recent price changes and positive earnings growth, this cluster highlighted companies that are rapidly expanding and may offer significant returns. Investors with a higher risk tolerance and long-term growth focus would find this cluster beneficial.
- `Cluster 3 - High Liquidity, Strong Financial Health`: This cluster included stocks with high cash ratios and strong net cash flows, indicating companies with robust financial stability. These stocks are suited for conservative investors seeking secure, liquidity-focused investments.
- `Cluster 4 - High Volatility, Speculative Stocks`: This cluster comprised stocks with high price volatility and lower net income stability, identifying them as more speculative investments. This group may appeal to investors interested in short-term gains but aware of the increased risk.

### **Impact**

The clustering analysis provided Trade&Ahead with clear, actionable insights into stock segmentation, enabling them to recommend specific stocks tailored to each clientâ€™s risk appetite and financial goals. By categorizing stocks into distinct financial profiles, Trade&Ahead can now guide clients toward diversified portfolios that manage risk across various market conditions.

### **Project Outcome**

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of unsupervised learning and clustering methodologies, particularly in optimizing K-Means for financial data and interpreting clustering results within a real-world business context. This project highlights my ability to turn complex financial datasets into structured, meaningful insights that support investment strategy and client decision-making.

### Business Context

The stock market has consistently proven to be a good place to invest in and save for the future. There are a lot of compelling reasons to invest in stocks. It can help in fighting inflation, create wealth, and also provides some tax benefits. Good steady returns on investments over a long period of time can also grow a lot more than seems possible. Also, thanks to the power of compound interest, the earlier one starts investing, the larger the corpus one can have for retirement. Overall, investing in stocks can help meet life's financial aspirations.

It is important to maintain a diversified portfolio when investing in stocks in order to maximize earnings under any market condition. Having a diversified portfolio tends to yield higher returns and face lower risk by tempering potential losses when the market is down. It is often easy to get lost in a sea of financial metrics to analyze while determining the worth of a stock, and doing the same for a multitude of stocks to identify the right picks for an individual can be a tedious task. By doing a cluster analysis, one can identify stocks that exhibit similar characteristics and ones which exhibit minimum correlation. This will help investors better analyze stocks across different market segments and help protect against risks that could make the portfolio vulnerable to losses.

### Objective

Trade&Ahead is a financial consultancy firm who provide their customers with personalized investment strategies. They have hired you as a Data Scientist and provided you with data comprising stock price and some financial indicators for a few companies listed under the New York Stock Exchange. They have assigned you the tasks of analyzing the data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.
